What Does Chat Mean?
Chat refers to the process of communicating, interacting and/or exchanging messages over the Internet. It involves two or more individuals that communicate through a chat-enabled service or software.

Chat is also known as chatting, online chat or Internet chat.



*******************************************************************************************************************
On the Internet, chatting is talking to other people who are using the Internet at the same time you are. Usually, this "talking" is the exchange of typed-in messages requiring one site as the repository for the messages (or "chat site") and a group of users who take part from anywhere on the Internet. In some cases, a private chat can be arranged between two parties who meet initially in a group chat. Chats can be ongoing or scheduled for a particular time and duration. Most chats are focused on a particular topic of interest and some involve guest experts or famous people who "talk" to anyone joining the chat. (Transcripts of a chat can be archived for later reference.)

Chats are conducted on online services (especially America Online), by bulletin board services, and by Web sites. Several Web sites, notably Talk City, exist solely for the purpose of conducting chats. Some chat sites such as Worlds Chat allow participants to assume the role or appearance of an avatar in a simulated or virtual reality environment.

Talk City and many other chat sites use a protocol called Internet Relay Chat.

A chat can also be conducted using sound or sound and video, assuming you have the bandwidth access and the appropriate programming.

Chat may be delivered through text, verbal, audio, visual or audio-visual (A/V) communication via the Internet. If conducted through a desktop, chat requires software that supports Internet Relay Chat (IRC) or an instant messenger application, where a central server manages chat communication between different end user clients.

There are also online chat services that require users to sign up with a valid email address. After signing up, a user may join a group chat room or send a private message to another individual. Online chat services have purpose-built chat interfaces that manage the entire communication processes.
